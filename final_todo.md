Evaluation:
	Give examples, show that it kinda works
		General expectations

	Comparison vs last version

	Things not to do with sound
		speed, performance etc.

	Mention all the known shortcomings
		Bugs etc.
	
	And all the stuff it does well

# TODO

- add dimensions + volume readout to display

- demos
	- set up demos and save a Wayverb project for each
		- [x] reverb times for three different room sizes (constant materials +
			  source/receiver spacing)											different cuboids
		- [x] different source/receiver spacings in the same room				medium cuboid
		- [x] tunnel for late echoes											echo_tunnel
		- [x] hidden receiver (no direct)										vault

		- [ ] cardioid receiver (no direct response)							medium sized room
		- [x] binaural receiver (different ITD and ILD)							concert hall
		
	- present the demos
		- impulse response + dry/wet demo for each
		- waveform or spectrogram as appropriate

		- check reverb times / rt60s
            - it's weird that the raytracer has a longer rt60 than the waveguide

- evaluation
	- talk about the demos a bit
		- how to structure demos + evaluation?

- abstract

- software UI documentation

- go back over writing

- declaration, according to guidelines
