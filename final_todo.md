Monday: software status

Software is the priority!
	Ray tracer crackly-ness
		Why don't we see this in the waveguide?

	Generate parts separately 

Research aims
	Make it clear that I'm assessing the efficiency + scalability of the approaches

	Make the narrative really clear

Evaluation:
	Give examples, show that it kinda works
		General expectations

	Comparison vs last version

	Things not to do with sound
		speed, performance etc.

	Mention all the known shortcomings
		Bugs etc.
	
	And all the stuff it does well
