# General

research aims
	highlight specific work undertaken, actual problems solved
	more emphasis on decisions and practical experimentation
	refer back to criteria set up here

be explicit about where I've tried several things and chosen a solution
	give better context for decisions

look over boundary tests again, try with less flat filters
