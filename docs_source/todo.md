# TODO

overall diagram?

images click to zoom
fix image sizes 
	96 dpi

look over boundary tests again, try with less flat filters

re-do diagrams for test setup and boundary types, using sketch
	maybe show an actual mesh with colour coded boundary nodes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# General

research aims
	highlight specific work undertaken, actual problems solved
	more emphasis on decisions and practical experimentation
	Make sure criteria are obvious, so I can refer back to them

be explicit about where I've tried several things and chosen a solution
	give better context for decisions

If I've done anything (implementation included) that's not in the literature,
make it clear that that's an original contribution.

Fix references to be less abrupt, use names.
