# Acoustics Simulation Techniques

# Existing Software

Room acoustics simulation is not a new topic of research.
The first documented method for estimating a room impulse response was put
forward by @krokstad_calculating_1968, who suggested a geometric method based
on ray tracing.

TODO Since then... 

Searching online uncovers a handful of programs for acoustic simulation:
