# Acoustics Simulation Techniques

# Existing Software

Room acoustics simulation is not a new topic of research.
In 1968, Krokstad, Strøm and Sørsdal published their paper entitled
"Calculating acoustical room response by use of a ray tracing technique",
presenting the first use of computerized ray tracing to find the impulse
response of a 3D model [@krokstad1968].

TODO Since then... 

Searching online uncovers a handful of programs for acoustic simulation:
