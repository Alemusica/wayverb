> Add title “Abstract” to the abstract.

Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Figure 2.1 is not referred to in the text

p28 2nd paragraph: Added reference, now numbered figure 3.1 due to extra Theory
chapter.

> “when…”

p30 1st paragraph: Gives a concrete example of the effects of exponential
complexity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 20 “number to checks” should be “number of checks”

p31 4th paragraph: Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 24 second paragraph line 5 – shouldn’t “statistical” be “stochastic”

p36 2nd paragraph: Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 25 last paragraph – “25s” should be “25µs”. Also KHz should be kHz.

p36 last paragraph: Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 27 fifth paragraph – “which a common descriptor” should be “which is a
> common descriptor”

p38 last paragraph: Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 27 can you give a reference for equation 9 (or are you implying this
> equation is obvious from your preceding description?) 

p38 penultimate paragraph: The equation should follow from the description,
yes. Added the sentence beginning "It follows..." to clarify. Also added
intermediate form to eq. 4.4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 28 KHz should be kHz

Fixed throughout

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 30 “be this same” should be “be the same”

p41 penultimate paragraph: Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 34 following equation 23 please clarify what c, T and X are.

p46 following eq. 5.7: Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Figure 4.2 “Black lines” should be “Blue lines”. Is there any way you can
> redraw the tetrahedral one so it’s easier to see (maybe put it in twice for
> the two orientations? Or use different colours for the two orientations?)

pp48-49: Maybe the printout was bad, but the lines really are black. Added
diagram 5.3 showing tetrahedral structure in more detail. Added explanatory
text in the second paragraph of p48.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 40 “like and obvious” should be “like an obvious”. Also KHz should be
> kHz.

p53 1st paragraph: Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 40 bottom paragraph says following figure but it is referring to the
> figure after the following one.

p53 3rd paragraph: Text refers directly to figure 5.5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 41 KHz should be kHz.

Fixed throughout

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 42 Figure 4.4 on each graph a line goes from (0,0) to the top left
> corner and bottom right corner of the excitation signal – this appears to be
> a presentational error and needs correcting. Also it is unclear to me why the
> amplitudes on Dirac, Ricker and PCS are “filled in” – is this fluctuation in
> amplitude that is lost in the resolution or a presentational problem? If the
> former just clarify if the latter please fix.

p55: Figure adjusted to remove the diagonal lines (these were supposed to
indicate the "zoomed-in" region of the graph, although this is so small that
they are essentially useless). The graphs are filled-in due to high-frequency
fluctuations, which is clarified in the figure annotation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Figure 4.6 not referred to in text.

p59 5th paragraph: This paragraph added to explain the need for figure 5.7,
which is referenced in the text.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 49 last line of first paragraph – “exceptional” is it possible to be a
> little more precise or use more restrained language…

p63 1st paragraph: changed "without requiring exceptional computing power" to
"but for a much lower computational cost than would be possible with any
individual method".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 49 3rd paragraph suggest delete word “maybe”

p63 3rd paragraph: Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 50 “no concrete rule to place” should be something like “no concrete
> rule about where to place”

p64 3rd paragraph: Now reads "no concrete rule governing where to place"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 50 Last sentence – is it possible in any way to indicatively quantify
> “very large”, “reasonable” and “excessive” or reword to be more precise?

p64 last paragraph: Clarified derivation of overall simulation complexity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 51 first paragraph. Suggest adding a sentence to complete the paragraph
> saying what Wayverb does (you’ve said what it doesn’t do!)

p65 1st paragraph: Added explanation of Wayverb's behaviour, along with
justification.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 53 “the to end” should be “the top end”

p68 1st paragraph: Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 55 KHz should be kHz

Fixed throughout

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 57 fifth paragraph – needs a little clarification – AB pair add “spaced”
> and I presume you are referring to “omnis”. Similarly for “XY” add
> “co-incident” and I presume cardiods or figure-of-8.

p73 last paragraph: Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 58 first line – “four coincident directional” should be 3 plus an
> omnidirectional

p74 1st paragraph: Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 58 “front the microphone” should be “front of the microphone”

p75 1st paragraph: Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 59 bottom sentence. Looks like you are taking advantage of left right
> symmetry in arriving at 288 – if so please claify this.

p76 1st paragraph: Not sure exactly how to interpret this. For the most part,
Wayverb assumes that both ears share the same location, and therefore the same
raw data is used to compute the left and right ear responses. Added an
explanation of the number of horizontal and vertical divisions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 65 KHz should be kHz

Fixed throughout

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 67 KHz should be kHz

Fixed throughout

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 75 KHz should be kHz

Fixed throughout

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Equations can’t be told from figures – don’t like style of referencing
> figures

Fixed throughout

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 78, 84 and 87 have unlabelled tables. Please label and then refer to in
> text.

All tables now labelled, referenced in the text.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 85 Figure 8.2 title at top should say “T30” not “RT30”

Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 87 fifth paragraph first sentence change “several” to “three”

"Direct Response Time" 1st paragraph: Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Figure 8.4 and 8.5 are not referred to in the text – please correct

Fig. 9.5 referenced in final paragraph of "Reverb Times for Varying
Absorptions"

Fig. 9.6 referenced in final paragraph of "Direct Response Time"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Page 100 “acoustics arbitrary” should be “acoustics of arbitrary”

First paragraph of "Summary": Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Conclusions should be a section in its own right

Moved Analysis section of Evaluation onwards to a new Conclusion chapter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> References – despite the explanatory sentence at the start I feel that
> references 78 onwards - which are not cited in the text - should be deleted
> or placed in a Bibliography (or similarly named) section

Removed unreferenced references.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> I’m not convinced about the style used for referring to figures. I’ve not
> seen it done this way before.  Unless you can convince me with an example
> that this is a valid approach I’d like you to change “figure (x.x)” to
> “Figure 2.3”. The same applies to referring to equations. In particular page

> 41 and equation 44

Changed to a more normal "fig. x.y" scheme for figures, "eq. x.y" for
equations, and "table x.y" for tables.

## External Examiner

> Bring together background theory into a single chapter that precedes the more
> focused technical work and discussion. This should for instance consider
> basic room acoustic theory and metrics for success used – at the moment these
> aspects are scattered throughout the other chapters and in some cases
> repeated. This proposed chapter is essentially a restructure of work already
> presented rather than asking for new literature work to be completed.
> However, it should also include a proper consideration of this research as it
> is applied in more creative contexts. Although the nature of the thesis and
> the field is highly multidisciplinary, given its arts/humanities,
> science/engineering backgrounds, an MA-Research thesis should have its
> foundation and justification in the creative arts and relevant humanities
> focused scholarship.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Each chapter needs a proper summary. At the moment the chapters move on from
> one to the other tackling various technical issues, but with no reflection on
> what has been achieved in each case, or considering the implication of any
> interim results (if given).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> A proper Conclusion chapter is needed, rather than just a section in another
> chapter. This should be separated off from the current existing final
> chapter. It should summarise the work completed, drawing on the evidence
> presented in the results obtained, provide a proper discussion, reflection on
> the research aims stated at the beginning of the thesis, and considerations
> for future work. Again, this is more of a restructure than writing new
> content, but I would encourage the candidate to more completely consider the
> research questions posed at the beginning of the thesis – that is, the nature
> of accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility. These are actually very difficult
> questions to ask, and so to answer, and in fact have not been properly
> addressed in this work (e.g. accuracy might consider listening tests as well
> as objective measures; efficiency should include algorithmic performance
> metrics; accessibility might include user tests) I am not suggesting that
> these research questions should be changed or more work done towards them at
> this stage, but the candidate should consider them more carefully, and what –
> if appropriate – might be more appropriate questions for this work, and again
> in the context of an MA thesis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p8: KHz is used throughout instead of kHz – please correct.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p12 - Project Aims: although I am not suggesting that these should be
> rewritten, their scope might be more focused to enable a more complete
> analysis and reflection in the conclusions. Also it states that this work
> should not required any specialist training in ‘acoustics or programming’ yet
> the thesis that follows is absolutely founded on both, and this assumption
> has not actually been properly tested as stated above.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p18: Audibility checking example above paragraph starting ‘The validation….’
> should map to Figure 2.2 for clarity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p19: what does the author mean by ‘reasonable time’? Refer back to project
> aims/research questions. In general, such loosely defined terms are used at
> quite a few points in the thesis and mean very little.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p23: How has this replacement of the Dirac function with the truncated IR of
> a low-pass filter been tested? In general, it would be expected to see some
> interim results here of the IS algorithm as presented. Summary also needed as
> suggested above.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p25: ‘25s’ – units incorrect.

> p26: Vorlander = Vorländer (please correct throughout)

> p27: define the scattering coefficient ‘s’ (some of this detail comes later
> in the report, hence the need, in part, for a literature/theory chapter
> earlier).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p28: Reflections are considered here – but no consideration is given
> regarding octave band considerations. Should they be? Please see comments
> about a ‘new’ literature review/background chapter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p36: Please define ‘accuracy’ in the context of your discussion regarding
> mesh topologies. What constitutes an ‘accurate’ result?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p40: [jeong_source_2012] please fix reference …like and obvious = like an
> Figure 4.3 – y-axis magnitudes of frequency domain plots should have dB
> scale?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p43: Regarding stability, this paper should be considered and cited:

> Difference Models Used in Audio and Room Acoustics,” IEEE/ACM Trans. Audio
> Speech Lang. Process., vol. 22, no. 9, pp. 1403–1412, Sep. 2014.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p44: “Now the inner….” Please rephrase the start of this section for readability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Figure 4.6: This should be discussed or referred to in the main body of the text.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p51: Discussion is given as to hybrid crossover frequency but never formally
> cited or justified.  Please do so.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p53: ‘and at the to end’ - ?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p56: T20 and T30 used before definition in later chapter. See comments on a
> proper literature review.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p61: This achieved by taking = This is achieved

> p62: Hacıhabiboglu = Hacıhabiboğlu

> p63: Does mesh oversampling always need to be used? Cannot interpolation be
> applied in some cases? Please Comment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p68: Define ‘$’

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p74: Define what you mean by ‘realism’ in the context of this section.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p78: Define what you mean by ‘reasonably accurate’ in the context of this section.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p80: ‘Little low frequency error’ – again, please define what you mean here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p82: Define RT60 in relation to T20 and T30. Your assumption that RT60 =
> 2xT30 = 2xT20 is incorrect. Please refer to ISO3382 and related versions of

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Fig 8.2 – What are Octave band RT30 measurements? Be clear about what you are

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> and are they actually ‘accurate’?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> General point - A better approach to testing a study of this nature is

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Your comment on the ‘issue with shorter low-frequency decay times’ needs more

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p89: ‘Therefore it is obvious’ – I’m not sure the results presented here mean

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p92: Please make clear where diffraction is indicated in Fig. 8.7 ‘The low

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p94, Fig 8.9 – I would suggest adding the plot for the cardioid microphone
> pointing to the source here in another colour. Would make the case very
> clearly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p95: ‘A concert hall is simulated…’ – where and what are the details of this
> model? Please give the details of this test. I would improve Fig 8.10, to
> make the differences clearer, used a scale that enables ITD values to be

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Analysis – move this and what follows to a proper Conclusion Chapter as
> discussed above.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> ‘precise stereo effects’ – strictly, you have not demonstrated this.
> Listening tests would be needed.  Points about no diffraction in the ray
> tracer are fair, but the mis-match between modelling approaches and reverb

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> p101: ‘the finished project is sufficiently accessible’ – as determined by whom?
