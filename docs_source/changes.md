common descriptor”*

4.2.1 last paragraph: Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Page 27 can you give a reference for equation 9 (or are you implying this
equation is obvious from your preceding description?)*

4.2.1 penultimate paragraph: The equation should follow from the description,
yes. Added the sentence beginning "It follows…" to clarify. Also added
intermediate form to eq. 4.4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

redraw the tetrahedral one so it’s easier to see (maybe put it in twice for the
two orientations? Or use different colours for the two orientations?)*

5.2.1: Maybe the print quality was poor, but the lines are black. Added diagram

*Page 41 KHz should be kHz.*

Fixed throughout

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Page 42 Figure 4.4 on each graph a line goes from (0,0) to the top left corner
and bottom right corner of the excitation signal – this appears to be a
presentational error and needs correcting. Also it is unclear to me why the
amplitudes on Dirac, Ricker and PCS are “filled in” – is this fluctuation in
amplitude that is lost in the resolution or a presentational problem? If the
former just clarify if the latter please fix.*

5.2.2.2 fig. 5.5: Figure adjusted to remove the diagonal lines. The graphs are
filled-in due to high-frequency fluctuations, which is clarified in the figure
annotation.

5.3.3 final paragraph: This paragraph added to explain the need for figure 5.7,
which is referenced in the text.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Page 49 last line of first paragraph – “exceptional” is it possible to be a
little more precise or use more restrained language…*

6.1 1st paragraph: changed "without requiring exceptional computing power" to
"but for a much lower computational cost than would be possible with any
individual method".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Page 49 3rd paragraph suggest delete word “maybe”*

6.2.1 1st paragraph: Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Page 50 “no concrete rule to place” should be something like “no concrete rule
about where to place”*

6.2.2 1st paragraph: Now reads "no concrete rule governing where to place"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Page 50 Last sentence – is it possible in any way to indicatively quantify
“very large”, “reasonable” and “excessive” or reword to be more precise?*

6.2.2 2nd paragraph: Clarified derivation of overall simulation complexity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Page 51 first paragraph. Suggest adding a sentence to complete the paragraph

6.2.2 3rd paragraph: Added explanation of Wayverb's behaviour, along with
justification.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Page 53 “the to end” should be “the top end”*

6.3.2 2nd paragraph: Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Page 55 KHz should be kHz*

Fixed throughout

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Page 57 fifth paragraph – needs a little clarification – AB pair add “spaced”
and I presume you are referring to “omnis”. Similarly for “XY” add
“co-incident” and I presume cardiods or figure-of-8.*

7.2 2nd paragraph: Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Page 58 first line – “four coincident directional” should be 3 plus an
omnidirectional*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Page 58 “front the microphone” should be “front of the microphone”*

7.3.1 2nd paragraph: Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Page 59 bottom sentence. Looks like you are taking advantage of left right
symmetry in arriving at 288 – if so please claify this.*

7.3.2 last paragraph: Not sure exactly how to interpret this.  Wayverb assumes
that both ears share the same location, at least for the purposes of histogram
creation, and therefore the same raw data is used to compute the left and right
ear responses. Added an explanation of the number of horizontal and vertical
divisions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Page 65 KHz should be kHz*

Fixed throughout

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Page 67 KHz should be kHz*

Fixed throughout

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Page 75 KHz should be kHz*

Fixed throughout

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Equations can’t be told from figures – don’t like style of referencing
figures*

Fixed throughout

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Page 78, 84 and 87 have unlabelled tables. Please label and then refer to in
text.*

All are tables now labelled and referenced in the text.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Page 85 Figure 8.2 title at top should say “T30” not “RT30”*

9.2.1: Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Page 87 fifth paragraph first sentence change “several” to “three”*

9.2.2 1st paragraph: Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Figure 8.4 and 8.5 are not referred to in the text – please correct*

9.2.2 last paragraph: Fig. 9.5 referenced

9.2.3 last paragraph: Fig. 9.6 referenced in final paragraph of "Direct
Response Time"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Page 100 “acoustics arbitrary” should be “acoustics of arbitrary”*

10.2 1st paragraph: Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Conclusions should be a section in its own right*

Moved the Analysis section of the Evaluation chapter onwards to a new
Conclusion chapter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*References – despite the explanatory sentence at the start I feel that
references 78 onwards - which are not cited in the text - should be deleted
or placed in a Bibliography (or similarly named) section*

Removed unused references.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*I’m not convinced about the style used for referring to figures. I’ve not
seen it done this way before.  Unless you can convince me with an example
that this is a valid approach I’d like you to change “figure (x.x)” to
“Figure 2.3”. The same applies to referring to equations. In particular page
74 second last paragraph needs to make it clear it is referring to equation
41 and equation 44*

Changed to a more normal "fig. x.y" scheme for figures, "eq. x.y" for
equations, and "table x.y" for tables.

## External Examiner

*Bring together background theory into a single chapter that precedes the more
focused technical work and discussion. This should for instance consider
basic room acoustic theory and metrics for success used – at the moment these
aspects are scattered throughout the other chapters and in some cases
repeated. This proposed chapter is essentially a restructure of work already
presented rather than asking for new literature work to be completed.
However, it should also include a proper consideration of this research as it
is applied in more creative contexts. Although the nature of the thesis and
the field is highly multidisciplinary, given its arts/humanities,
science/engineering backgrounds, an MA-Research thesis should have its
foundation and justification in the creative arts and relevant humanities
focused scholarship.*

Added Chapter 2, which covers equations governing wave behaviour, boundary
models, and reverb time estimates and measurements.  The majority of the
information on boundary modelling has been moved from the beginning of the
Boundary Modelling chapter. The "creative context" is quite a different topic
to the background theory, so this was added to the existing Context chapter,
rather than to the new Theory chapter. The creative context can be found in
section 1.4, under the heading "Acoustic Simulation and the Creative Arts".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Each chapter needs a proper summary. At the moment the chapters move on from
one to the other tackling various technical issues, but with no reflection on
what has been achieved in each case, or considering the implication of any
interim results (if given).*

All chapters now have a reflective summary which attempts to fulfil this
requirement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*A proper Conclusion chapter is needed, rather than just a section in another
chapter. This should be separated off from the current existing final
chapter. It should summarise the work completed, drawing on the evidence
presented in the results obtained, provide a proper discussion, reflection on
the research aims stated at the beginning of the thesis, and considerations
for future work. Again, this is more of a restructure than writing new
content, but I would encourage the candidate to more completely consider the
research questions posed at the beginning of the thesis – that is, the nature
of accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility. These are actually very difficult
questions to ask, and so to answer, and in fact have not been properly
addressed in this work (e.g. accuracy might consider listening tests as well
as objective measures; efficiency should include algorithmic performance
metrics; accessibility might include user tests) I am not suggesting that
these research questions should be changed or more work done towards them at
this stage, but the candidate should consider them more carefully, and what –
if appropriate – might be more appropriate questions for this work, and again
in the context of an MA thesis.*

Everything from the "Analysis" section of the Evaluation chapter forwards has
been moved to its own "Conclusion" chapter. This chapter begins with a new
discussion of the testing procedure, and its shortcomings. It was not feasible
to conduct further work towards the research goals, and instead ideas for tests
which would have allowed more conclusive results to be drawn have been
suggested in section 10.1.1. The "Simulation Method" section has been renamed
to "Evaluation of Project Goals" (10.1.2) and updated to individually consider
each of the research goals. The section on plausibility (10.1.2.1) has been
adjusted to discuss the interplay between different components of the
simulation. The paragraphs about efficiency (10.1.2.2) have been rewritten, and
no longer discuss use in architectural contexts which are not relevant to the
project aims. A completely new section on accessibility (10.1.2.3) has been
added, which covers the design goals of the interface, some background on the
implementation, and suggests future improvements. Finally, the summary (10.2)
has been slightly extended to explain that the project scope was too broad, and
that Wayverb's main contribution is a starting point for future projects,
rather than a tool which is useful in its own right.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p8: KHz is used throughout instead of kHz – please correct.*

Fixed throughout

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p12 - Project Aims: although I am not suggesting that these should be
rewritten, their scope might be more focused to enable a more complete
analysis and reflection in the conclusions. Also it states that this work
should not required any specialist training in ‘acoustics or programming’ yet
the thesis that follows is absolutely founded on both, and this assumption
has not actually been properly tested as stated above.*

1.5: Slightly reworded these. In particular, "accuracy" was changed to
"plausibility" as this seems more useful in creative contexts. Rewrote the
discussion of plausibility, to focus it more on the aspects of the program
which are actually tested. Clarified the need for a sliding scale between
quality and speed. Added sentence to explain why accessibility is less
important than the first two goals. The "specialist training" comment was
supposed to refer to users of the software, so this has been made clearer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p18: Audibility checking example above paragraph starting ‘The validation….’
should map to Figure 2.2 for clarity.*

3.1.2 last paragraph: added reference to fig. 3.2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p19: what does the author mean by ‘reasonable time’? Refer back to project
aims/research questions. In general, such loosely defined terms are used at
quite a few points in the thesis and mean very little.*

3.1.3 1st paragraph: Added concrete example of exponential simulation time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p23: How has this replacement of the Dirac function with the truncated IR of
a low-pass filter been tested? In general, it would be expected to see some
interim results here of the IS algorithm as presented. Summary also needed as
suggested above.*

The need for further tests is now recognised in the conclusion, but it was not
feasible to produce new results. Summary has been added (section 3.3).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p25: ‘25s’ – units incorrect.*

4.1.4 3rd paragraph: now 25µs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p26: Vorlander = Vorländer (please correct throughout)*

Fixed throughout.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p27: define the scattering coefficient ‘s’ (some of this detail comes later in
the report, hence the need, in part, for a literature/theory chapter earlier).*

This is now discussed in section 2.2.2. The Theory chapter is referenced in the
paragraph following eq. 4.3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p28: Reflections are considered here – but no consideration is given regarding
octave band considerations. Should they be? Please see comments about a ‘new’
literature review/background chapter.*

4.2.2: Clarified that there is a histogram per frequency band.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p36: Please define ‘accuracy’ in the context of your discussion regarding mesh
topologies. What constitutes an ‘accurate’ result?*

5.2.1 3rd paragraph: Defined the accuracy criterion for mesh topologies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p40: [jeong_source_2012] please fix reference*

5.2.2.2 4th paragraph: fixed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*…like and obvious = like an*

5.2.2.2 4th paragraph: fixed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Figure 4.3 – y-axis magnitudes of frequency domain plots should have dB
scale?*

Linear scales are required in order to display the similarity between the shape
of each pulse in the time and frequency domains.  Also, pulse spectra are given
on a linear scale in fig. 1 of the following paper.  Therefore, I believe this
approach is valid.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p43: Regarding stability, this paper should be considered and cited:*

Difference Models Used in Audio and Room Acoustics,” IEEE/ACM Trans. Audio
Speech Lang. Process., vol. 22, no. 9, pp. 1403–1412, Sep. 2014.*

5.2.2.2 fourth-from-last paragraph: Added this paragraph which explains that
numerical error is a plausible cause of simulation growth (based on the results
in that paper), but that increasing numerical precision is not viable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p44: “Now the inner….” Please rephrase the start of this section for
readability.*

5.3.2: Changed first sentence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Figure 4.6: This should be discussed or referred to in the main body of the
text.*

5.3.3 last paragraph: Refers to what is now fig. 5.7

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p51: Discussion is given as to hybrid crossover frequency but never formally
cited or justified.  Please do so.*

6.2.2 last paragraph: added references supporting the approach in Wayverb.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p53: ‘and at the to end’ - ?*

6.3.2 2nd paragraph: fixed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p56: T20 and T30 used before definition in later chapter. See comments on a
proper literature review.*

Discussion of reverb time given in Chapter 2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p61: This achieved by taking = This is achieved*

7.5 last paragraph: fixed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p62: Hacıhabiboglu = Hacıhabiboğlu*

Fixed throughout

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p63: Does mesh oversampling always need to be used? Cannot interpolation be
applied in some cases? Please Comment.*

7.6.1.1 4th paragraph: Added reference to paper dealing with interpolation for
receivers in 2D meshes, and explanation of why this technique is not viable in
3D.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p67: ‘At low frequencies’ – define what you mean by ‘low’. Nothing is
presented for below 500Hz, which is where your DWM approach will be applied?
Hence these results are invalid in the context of your work? What do the
colours in Figs 6.1 – 6.3 refer to? This is not explained. If the
black/darker colour is a reference, from where has it been obtained?*

7.6.3 4th paragraph: "low frequencies" changed to "the lower frequencies
shown". Results re-computed and graphed starting at 100Hz. Graph colours
explained in the 3rd paragraph of this section.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Chapter 7: Some repetition here of Image Source section. See comments made
earlier.*

All background information moved to Chapter 2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p68: Define ‘$’*

This was a typesetting error, now fixed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p74: Define what you mean by ‘realism’ in the context of this section.*

8.3.2: reworded to "physically-based behaviour" and added explanation that the
LRS technique considers edges as well as flat surfaces.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p78: Define what you mean by ‘reasonably accurate’ in the context of this
section.*

8.4.3 1st paragraph: reworded to remove ambiguous claim.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p79: Fig 7.6. I am not convinced that the higher frequency deviations from
the norm are down to dispersion error. This needs to be considered more
carefully, and I would inspect your raw IRs to see what is contributing to
this. Could be edge reflection effects from your surface, hard source
reflections, incorrect windowing? Does not look like dispersion error. Where
are the predicted results sourced from? The plots need to be improved – the
scales hide some of the detail. Would a difference/error plot be a better
metric?*

Now fig. 8.4: I checked the IRs, and they had very low amplitude. I re-ran the
tests using a higher-amplitude initial signal, and the generated graphs became
much smoother, leading me to believe that the magnitude of the signal was too
small relative to the floating-point epsilon in the original test, leading to a
loss of precision which caused noise in the graphed results. Figure 8.4 now
shows the results obtained using a higher-amplitude input. The scales have not
been adjusted, as they were chosen to show the entire range of outputs across
all tests, and having different scales on each graph may be misleading. Error
plots have not been supplied, as these were not given in the paper by Kowalczyk
upon which this boundary test is based.

I didn't previously discuss the source injection method for this test. This has
been added to the 2nd paragraph of 8.4.1, along with a rationale.

The first paragraph of the evaluation (8.4.3) has been rewritten to take more
possible causes of error into account.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p80: ‘Little low frequency error’ – again, please define what you mean here.
More investigation should be carried out into the source of the error or
limitations of this approach clearly discussed and the consequence for
subsequent results.*

This paragraph was removed, as it did not add to the discussion/was already
covered in the re-written paragraph. Test limitations are covered in that
paragraph. Implications for subsequent results are covered in the new chapter
summary (8.5).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p81: This is the first time that the nature of the 3D geometry files used to
define your rooms has been discussed at all. There is further discussion
later, in relation to the limitations of the software, but stating up front
that you will use a file importer from existing 3D CAD would be much better.*

Added a sentence to the explanation of Assimp in 1.6.2 explaining that users
can load CAD files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p82: Define RT60 in relation to T20 and T30. Your assumption that RT60 =
2xT30 = 2xT20 is incorrect. Please refer to ISO3382 and related versions of
this standard for a proper definition of how T20 and T30 are determined from
a RIR.*

This is done in Chapter 2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p84: What are the limitations of the Sabine equation? You should discuss this
and it may help with the interpretation of your results later? Is the cuboid
room you test a valid example for a Sabine estimation? In this test you
should also consider and average over more source/receiver positions to
arrive at a better estimation of RT60 for the room, which is what a Sabine
estimation gives (rather that something specific to a given source/receiver
pair).*

*How have you arrived at the results in the table? Please discuss.  %-error
might be a better metric to include, and also reference to JND for RT60.
Octave band results should also be included, rather than overall RT60, as
this will hide some possibly important detail.*

*If you are not able to re-do results, discuss the limitations of the test
instead.*

*This is where your results start to reveal that what has seemed ‘easy and
obvious’ based on the choices made in earlier chapters, do not give the best
results, giving rise to more questions – the number of choices and decisions
you have made are all highly complex and interact with each other when
producing the final result.  Why should your room resonate at 400Hz? What
physical reason is there for this? It could be down to the crossover of the
filters used in the hybrid model and how you have implemented them. Again, some
better discussion needed.*

Limitations of the Sabine equation are discussed in section 2.3.1, and in the
third-from-last paragraph of section 9.2.1. The penultimate paragraph of
section 9.2.1 was added, discussing the averaging of several source/receiver
positions. The final two paragraphs of the section discuss the limitations of
the test in more detail.

9.2.1 4th paragraph: Added that reverb times have been computed in accordance
with the ISO 3382 specification. Percentage errors have been added to the
table. Reference to JND added in the 5th paragraph. Octave-band results
are given in fig. 9.2, and table 9.2 has been added showing the percentage
differences in reverb times between the bands with the longest and shortest
reverb times for each room size.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p85: ‘In effect the waveguide exhibits a high noise-floor under some
conditions.’ Where have you shown this? How or why is this? More explanation
needed.*

The "noise floor" was supposed to refer to the continued oscillation at 400Hz,
40dB below the level of the initial contribution, which was clearly shown in
the spectrograms in figure 9.3.  However, "noise floor" was an incorrect
description and this sentence did not add to the discussion, so it has been
removed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Fig 8.2 – What are Octave band RT30 measurements? Be clear about what you are
plotting. If you are plotting octave band results we need to see the actual
data points you have, not just a connected line that joins them up. Please
also mark what aspect of you model has contributed to each plot point (e.g.
DWM, ISM, etc) ‘were placed’ = were replaced?  You should also check octave
band results vs broadband results if possible.*

Fig 9.2: corrected RT30 to T30. It should be clear from the 4th paragraph of
9.2.1 that the T30 measurements are derived in accordance with the ISO
specification. The data points have been marked more clearly, and the lines
replaced with dotted lines. The model crossover frequency has been marked. The
broadband results are given in table 9.1.

9.2.1 10th paragraph: placed -> replaced

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p87: ‘show that wall impedances are accurately modelled’ = define accurately,
and are they actually ‘accurate’?*

9.2.1 11th paragraph: replaced "impedances are accurately modelled" with
"reflectances generally match predicted values to within 1dB for three material
types and angles of incidence, at least in the band below 0.15 of the mesh
sampling rate".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*General point - A better approach to testing a study of this nature is
presented in reference [26].*

10.1.1 1st paragraph: the shortcomings of the testing procedure have been
discussed, and the method in [26] has been put forward as a better alternative.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Your comment on the ‘issue with shorter low-frequency decay times’ needs more
detail – we have no data to go on in relation to what these decay times are.
Give the data (octave bands) and discuss, or more speculative comments should
be removed.*

Fig 9.4: octave-band T30 measurements have been given. Table 9.4, showing the
difference between the minimum and maximum reverb time across all frequency
bands, has been added. In section 9.2.2 it has been made clear that
low-frequency bands have lower reverb times than high-frequency bands. The
final paragraph of 9.2.2 has been added to put forward evidence that the
low-frequency resonance at 400Hz seen in some tests is due to a deficiency
specifically in the boundary model.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p89: ‘Therefore it is obvious’ – I’m not sure the results presented here mean
that the conclusions you draw are in fact obvious. Energy metrics such as
C50/C80 or event EDT could have been used instead.*

Table 9.5: this table has been added, showing T20, T30, and EDT measurements,
along with percentage differences. The 2nd paragraph of 9.2.3 has been added,
explaining the purpose of the EDT measurement, and how the results can be
interpreted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p92: Please make clear where diffraction is indicated in Fig. 8.7 ‘The low
frequencies have a fast onset… extended decay’ I am not sure what you mean by
this, or that the conclusions you draw follow on as a consequence. It is more
likely that there are limitations with your implementation that have not as
yet been explored and tested fully.*

9.2.4 last paragraph: Replaced the "fast onset…" sentence with a few sentences
taking concrete readings from fig. 9.8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p94, Fig 8.9 – I would suggest adding the plot for the cardioid microphone
pointing to the source here in another colour. Would make the case very
clearly.*

Fig: 9.10 has been adjusted to include responses from two cardioid capsules,
one facing towards and one away from the receiver. Section 9.2.6 has been
adjusted accordingly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*p95: ‘A concert hall is simulated…’ – where and what are the details of this
model? Please give the details of this test. I would improve Fig 8.10, to
make the differences clearer, used a scale that enables ITD values to be
highlighted.*

9.2.7 1st paragraph: More details of the model are given here, and the
schematics are shown in fig. 9.11.

Fig 9.12 has been adjusted to cover a shorter time period, which should make
the ITD more obvious.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Analysis – move this and what follows to a proper Conclusion Chapter as
discussed above.*

Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*‘precise stereo effects’ – strictly, you have not demonstrated this.
Listening tests would be needed.  Points about no diffraction in the ray
tracer are fair, but the mis-match between modelling approaches and reverb
times is probably down to errors or assumptions that could be fixed or
improved?*

10.1.2.1 1st paragraph: the word "precise" has been removed. It has been noted
in 10.1.1 that proper listening tests are required, although it's evident that
some kind of stereo effect is possible from the results in fig 9.12.
