TODO: order these + all additional work
For each point, say what I've done
- create a table or some shit

In terms of tone: don't be definite if I'm not 100% sure of something
Be realistic - don't make something into something it's not

-[ ] SHOW MODAL RESPONSE OF DIFFERENT ROOM SIZES
  - refer to this in the evaluation

-[ ] Boundary modelling - say that it's worth extra investigation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Research aims

-[ ] Distinguish between key aims and secondary aims
-[ ] Discuss particular aspects of the simulation which should definitely work

# Musical context

- Film
- Virtual reality

- Sound design and music don't require the same level of real-world accuracy
  as architectural prediction. Instead, the constraints are
  - Perceived sound quality
  - Speed (important for fast iteration, auditioning)
  - Ease of use (presets, intuitive parameters)

# Conclusion

- discussion and reflection on research aims
- future work

- plausibility
- efficiency
- usability

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Research aims should be focused:
  - I kept them basically the same, but changed 'accuracy' to 'plausibility'
    Does this make sense?
  - Key aims vs secondary aims
    - Ease of use was a lesser aim than the technical stuff
    - I could have done usability tests
      - The work was limited to making appropriate gui decisions + building a gui
  - Accuracy is quite vague
    - Break that down into
      - The simulation should behave in a way appropriate to the model
        - Room modes
        - Echoes
      - Think about the tests I've done, and match them

- A proper consideration of this research as it is applied in more creative contexts
  - Make sure that what I do at the end and beginning line up
  - What he's picked up on is a bit of a mismatch
    - Talked about accessibility, but not discussed it
  - Define the arts and humanities context in a way I can justify it
  - A more general discussion of why people want control of certain things in
    certain contexts - film sound design of certain spaces
  - Evaluate in a realistic manner
    - This was the aim, but there are certain issues
    - Talk about some of the GUI decisions made for accessibility

- Conclusion:
  Need to more completely address the research questions.
  What kinds of questions should I be asking?
  He's said not to change the questions, or to do more work towards them.
  Should I simply discuss the limitations of the evaluation?
  i.e. should have done listening tests, tested the waveguide + geometric models in isolation, benchmarks etc.
  - What I might have done otherwise
  - The model does XYX, ABC, but not foobarbaz
  - Report how I got on
    - The more focused the research questions, the better I can discuss them
  - Really reflect on results
    - Discussion around that
  - Graphs or objective results
    - More tests - Say what I haven't tested, what I could test
  - If I write about creative usage, talk about where the tool might sit
    - What are the barriers to its use as a creative tool?
      - The need for 3D models
      - The efficiency
      - The plausibility/accuracy mismatch

- A better approach to testing a study of this nature is presented in reference...
  Does this mean I need to copy this approach? I don't think I have time to do that
  - Might be viable not to respond at all
  - Look and reflect
    - Mention in the conclusion - an alternative way to test a study of this nature
      would have been... (for these reasons)

- p23: How has the replacement of the dirac function with a windowed sinc been tested?
  Seems pretty obvious - the only worthwhile test would be purely technical/unit-style tests
  - He's asking to see the frequency response of the dirac function vs windowed sinc

- I don't have intermediate IS results, or a good way of testing it in isolation
  It says 'in general...' does that mean I need to produce results?
  - It may be OK to say that I don't have intermediate results to show

- p28: Check what this point means:
  Reflections are considered here - but no consideration is given regarding octave band considerations. Should they be?
  - Talk about reflections, but not in terms of frequency repsonse
  - Is it worth talking about this here

- p98: The candidate starts out by making a case for an efficient model - the actual model is not efficient enough.
  How can I address this without going back to established arguments that hardware improvements will help?
  - Maybe by making the case that the parallel nature of the software is uniquely placed to take advantage
    of hardware improvements going forward?
  - Take an aim - I haven't got where I wanted to go, but here's my reflection
  - Why did this happen?
  - What issues did I face?
  - How might I fix this in the future?
  - See it as an ongoing project - where is it now, how do my aims line up with the result?
