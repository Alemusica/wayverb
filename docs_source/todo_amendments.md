-[x] Add title “Abstract” to the abstract.

-[x] Page 7 line 13 “is also an problem” should be “is also a problem”

-[x] Figure 2.1 is not referred to in the text

-[x] Page 19 last sentence of first paragraph – sentence needs qualifying with “when…”

-[x] Page 20 “number to checks” should be “number of checks”

-[x] Page 24 second paragraph line 5 – shouldn’t “statistical” be “stochastic”

-[x] Page 25 last paragraph – “25s” should be “25µs”. Also KHz should be kHz.

-[x] Page 27 fifth paragraph – “which a common descriptor” should be “which is a common descriptor”

-[x] Page 27 can you give a reference for equation 9 (or are you implying this equation is obvious from your preceding description?) 

-[x] Page 28 KHz should be kHz

-[x] Page 30 “be this same” should be “be the same”

-[x] Page 34 following equation 23 please clarify what c, T and X are.

-[x] Figure 4.2 “Black lines” should be “Blue lines”. Is there any way you can redraw the tetrahedral one so it’s easier to see (maybe put it in twice for the two orientations? Or use different colours for the two orientations?)

-[x] Page 40 “like and obvious” should be “like an obvious”. Also KHz should be kHz.

-[x] Page 40 bottom paragraph says following figure but it is referring to the figure after the following one.

-[x] Page 41 KHz should be kHz.
 
-[x] Page 42 Figure 4.4 on each graph a line goes from (0,0) to the top left corner and bottom right corner of the excitation signal – this appears to be a presentational error and needs correcting. Also it is unclear to me why the amplitudes on Dirac, Ricker and PCS are “filled in” – is this fluctuation in amplitude that is lost in the resolution or a presentational problem? If the former just clarify if the latter please fix.

-[x] Figure 4.6 not referred to in text.

-[x] Page 49 last line of first paragraph – “exceptional” is it possible to be a little more precise or use more restrained language…

-[x] Page 49 3rd paragraph suggest delete word “maybe”

-[x] Page 50 “no concrete rule to place” should be something like “no concrete rule about where to place”

-[x] Page 50 Last sentence – is it possible in any way to indicatively quantify “very large”, “reasonable” and “excessive” or reword to be more precise?

-[x] Page 51 first paragraph. Suggest adding a sentence to complete the paragraph saying what Wayverb does (you’ve said what it doesn’t do!)

-[x] Page 53 “the to end” should be “the top end”

-[x] Page 55 KHz should be kHz

-[x] Page 57 fifth paragraph – needs a little clarification – AB pair add “spaced” and I presume you are referring to “omnis”. Similarly for “XY” add “co-incident” and I presume cardiods or figure-of-8.

-[x] Page 58 first line – “four coincident directional” should be 3 plus an omnidirectional

-[x] Page 58 “front the microphone” should be “front of the microphone”

-[x] Page 59 bottom sentence. Looks like you are taking advantage of left right symmetry in arriving at 288 – if so please claify this.

-[x] Page 65 KHz should be kHz

-[x] Page 67 KHz should be kHz

-[x] Page 75 KHz should be kHz

-[x] Equations can’t be told from figures – don’t like style of referencing figures

-[x] Page 78, 84 and 87 have unlabelled tables. Please label and then refer to in text.

-[x] Page 85 Figure 8.2 title at top should say “T30” not “RT30”

-[x] Page 87 fifth paragraph first sentence change “several” to “three”

-[x] Figure 8.4 and 8.5 are not referred to in the text – please correct

-[x] Page 100 “acoustics arbitrary” should be “acoustics of arbitrary”

-[x] Conclusions should be a section in its own right

-[x] References – despite the explanatory sentence at the start I feel that references 78 onwards - which are not cited in the text - should be deleted or placed in a Bibliography (or similarly named) section

-[x] I’m not convinced about the style used for referring to figures. I’ve not seen it done this way before.  Unless you can convince me with an example that this is a valid approach I’d like you to change “figure (x.x)” to “Figure 2.3”. The same applies to referring to equations. In particular page 74 second last paragraph needs to make it clear it is referring to equation 41 and equation 44

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-[x] p8: KHz is used throughout instead of kHz – please correct.

-[x] p12 - Project Aims: although I am not suggesting that these should be rewritten, their scope might be more focused to enable a more complete analysis and reflection in the conclusions. Also it states that this work should not required any specialist training in ‘acoustics or programming’ yet the thesis that follows is absolutely founded on both, and this assumption has not actually been properly tested as stated above.

-[x] p18: Audibility checking example above paragraph starting ‘The validation….’ should map to Figure 2.2 for clarity.

-[x] p19: what does the author mean by ‘reasonable time’? Refer back to project aims/research questions. In general, such loosely defined terms are used at quite a few points in the thesis and mean very little.

-[ ] p23: How has this replacement of the Dirac function with the truncated IR of a low-pass filter been tested? In general, it would be expected to see some interim results here of the IS algorithm as presented. Summary also needed as suggested above.

-[x] p25: ‘25s’ – units incorrect.

-[x] p26: Vorlander = Vorländer (please correct throughout)

-[ ] p27: define the scattering coefficient ‘s’ (some of this detail comes later in the report, hence the need, in part, for a literature/theory chapter earlier).

-[ ] p28: Reflections are considered here – but no consideration is given regarding octave band considerations. Should they be? Please see comments about a ‘new’ literature review/background chapter.

-[x] p36: Please define ‘accuracy’ in the context of your discussion regarding mesh topologies. What constitutes an ‘accurate’ result?

-[x] p40: [jeong_source_2012] please fix reference …like and obvious = like an Figure 4.3 – y-axis magnitudes of frequency domain plots should have dB scale?

-[x] p43: Regarding stability, this paper should be considered and cited:

J. Botts and L. Savioja, “Spectral and Pseudospectral Properties of Finite Difference Models Used
in Audio and Room Acoustics,” IEEE/ACM Trans. Audio Speech Lang. Process., vol. 22, no. 9, pp.
1403–1412, Sep. 2014.

-[x] p44: “Now the inner….” Please rephrase the start of this section for readability.

-[x] Figure 4.6: This should be discussed or referred to in the main body of the text.

-[x] p51: Discussion is given as to hybrid crossover frequency but never formally cited or justified.  Please do so.

-[x] p53: ‘and at the to end’ - ?

-[ ] p56: T20 and T30 used before definition in later chapter. See comments on a proper literature review.

-[x] p61: This achieved by taking = This is achieved

-[x] p62: Hacıhabiboglu = Hacıhabiboğlu

-[x] p63: Does mesh oversampling always need to be used? Cannot interpolation be applied in some cases? Please Comment.

-[x] p67: ‘At low frequencies’ – define what you mean by ‘low’. Nothing is presented for below 500Hz, which is where your DWM approach will be applied? Hence these results are invalid in the context of your work? What do the colours in Figs 6.1 – 6.3 refer to? This is not explained. If the black/darker colour is a reference, from where has it been obtained?

-[ ] Chapter 7: Some repetition here of Image Source section. See comments made earlier.

-[x] p68: Define ‘$’

-[x] p74: Define what you mean by ‘realism’ in the context of this section.

-[x] p78: Define what you mean by ‘reasonably accurate’ in the context of this section.

-[x] p79: Fig 7.6. I am not convinced that the higher frequency deviations from the norm are down to dispersion error. This needs to be considered more carefully, and I would inspect your raw IRs to see what is contributing to this. Could be edge reflection effects from your surface, hard source reflections, incorrect windowing? Does not look like dispersion error. Where are the predicted results sourced from? The plots need to be improved – the scales hide some of the detail. Would a difference/error plot be a better metric?

-[x] p80: ‘Little low frequency error’ – again, please define what you mean here. More investigation should be carried out into the source of the error or limitations of this approach clearly discussed and the consequence for subsequent results.

-[x] p81: This is the first time that the nature of the 3D geometry files used to define your rooms has been discussed at all. There is further discussion later, in relation to the limitations of the software, but stating up front that you will use a file importer from existing 3D CAD would be much better.

-[ ] p82: Define RT60 in relation to T20 and T30. Your assumption that RT60 = 2xT30 = 2xT20 is incorrect. Please refer to ISO3382 and related versions of this standard for a proper definition of how T20 and T30 are determined from a RIR.

-[x] p84: What are the limitations of the Sabine equation? You should discuss this and it may help with the interpretation of your results later? Is the cuboid room you test a valid example for a Sabine estimation? In this test you should also consider and average over more source/receiver positions to arrive at a better estimation of RT60 for the room, which is what a Sabine estimation gives (rather that something specific to a given source/receiver pair).  How have you arrived at the results in the table? Please discuss. %-error might be a better metric to include, and also reference to JND for RT60. Octave band results should also be included, rather than overall RT60, as this will hide some possibly important detail.  If you are not able to re-do results, discuss the limitations of the test instead.  This is where your results start to reveal that what has seemed ‘easy and obvious’ based on the choices made in earlier chapters, do not give the best results, giving rise to more questions – the number of choices and decisions you have made are all highly complex and interact with each other when producing the final result. Why should your room resonate at 400Hz? What physical reason is there for this? It could be down to the crossover of the filters used in the hybrid model and how you have implemented them. Again, some better discussion needed.

-[x] p85: ‘In effect the waveguide exhibits a high noise-floor under some conditions.’ Where have you shown this? How or why is this? More explanation needed.

-[x] Fig 8.2 – What are Octave band RT30 measurements? Be clear about what you are plotting. If you are plotting octave band results we need to see the actual data points you have, not just a connected line that joins them up. Please also mark what aspect of you model has contributed to each plot point (e.g. DWM, ISM, etc) ‘were placed’ = were replaced?  You should also check octave band results vs broadband results if possible.

-[x] p87: ‘show that wall impedances are accurately modelled’ = define accurately, and are they actually ‘accurate’?

-[x] General point - A better approach to testing a study of this nature is presented in reference [26].  Your comment on the ‘issue with shorter low-frequency decay times’ needs more detail – we have no data to go on in relation to what these decay times are. Give the data (octave bands) and discuss, or more speculative comments should be removed.

-[x] p89: ‘Therefore it is obvious’ – I’m not sure the results presented here mean that the conclusions you draw are in fact obvious. Energy metrics such as C50/C80 or event EDT could have been used instead.

-[x] p92: Please make clear where diffraction is indicated in Fig. 8.7 ‘The low frequencies have a fast onset… extended decay’ I am not sure what you mean by this, or that the conclusions you draw follow on as a consequence. It is more likely that there are limitations with your implementation that have not as yet been explored and tested fully.

-[x] p94, Fig 8.9 – I would suggest adding the plot for the cardioid microphone pointing to the source here in another colour. Would make the case very clearly.

-[x] p95: ‘A concert hall is simulated…’ – where and what are the details of this model? Please give the details of this test. I would improve Fig 8.10, to make the differences clearer, used a scale that enables ITD values to be highlighted.

-[x] Analysis – move this and what follows to a proper Conclusion Chapter as discussed above.

-[x] ‘precise stereo effects’ – strictly, you have not demonstrated this. Listening tests would be needed.  Points about no diffraction in the ray tracer are fair, but the mis-match between modelling approaches and reverb times is probably down to errors or assumptions that could be fixed or improved?

-[ ] p98: The candidate starts off in the early chapters by making a case for an efficient model, and that the time is right for this – but by this point in the report, goes back to established arguments that two more years computing advancements will help to solve the computational limits of the current implementation!

-[x] ‘than may be expected’ – but what is expected of the user interface and how has this been tested?

-[x] p101: ‘the finished project is sufficiently accessible’ – as determined by whom?

-[x] p102: Valimaki = Välimäki 

-[x] p107: Complete reference for [72] needed – where was this work presented?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 – Bring together background theory into a single chapter that precedes the
more focused technical work and discussion. This should for instance consider
basic room acoustic theory and metrics for success used – at the moment these
aspects are scattered throughout the other chapters and in some cases repeated.
This proposed chapter is essentially a restructure of work already presented
rather than asking for new literature work to be completed. However, it should
also include a proper consideration of this research as it is applied in more
creative contexts.  Although the nature of the thesis and the field is highly
multidisciplinary, given its arts/humanities, science/engineering backgrounds,
an MA-Research thesis should have its foundation and justification in the
creative arts and relevant humanities focused scholarship.

2 – Each chapter needs a proper summary. At the moment the chapters move on
from one to the other tackling various technical issues, but with no reflection
on what has been achieved in each case, or considering the implication of any
interim results (if given).

3 – A proper Conclusion chapter is needed, rather than just a section in
another chapter. This should be separated off from the current existing final
chapter. It should summarise the work completed, drawing on the evidence
presented in the results obtained, provide a proper discussion, reflection on
the research aims stated at the beginning of the thesis, and considerations for
future work. Again, this is more of a restructure than writing new content, but
I would encourage the candidate to more completely consider the research
questions posed at the beginning of the thesis – that is, the nature of
accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility. These are actually very difficult
questions to ask, and so to answer, and in fact have not been properly
addressed in this work (e.g. accuracy might consider listening tests as well as
objective measures; efficiency should include algorithmic performance metrics;
accessibility might include user tests) I am not suggesting that these research
questions should be changed or more work done towards them at this stage, but
the candidate should consider them more carefully, and what – if appropriate –
might be more appropriate questions for this work, and again in the context of
an MA thesis.

-[ ] Revisit the point about p84 - redo tests if there's time, try isolating
parts of the output to localise the 400Hz resonance.

-[ ] Remember to discuss EDT in the literature section
