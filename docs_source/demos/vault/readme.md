The source and receiver are separated by 7 metres, which would generally lead
to a direct contribution after 0.0206 seconds. However, in this model, the source
is obscured by a pillar, which means that there is no direct contribution at
this time.

This model also uses materials with greater absorption in higher bands.  The
output exhibits the expected faster attenuation at high frequencies than low
frequencies.
