These are the sources for the site and documentation.
The site is based on a template by [HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net), modified to
add a sidebar on 'content' pages, and to use jekyll's built-in sass support.
The license for the site template is included, as per the terms of the license,
in LICENSE.txt.
Please note that this license *only* covers the design of the site - page
templates, (s)css, and javascript.

Site content (including but not limited to markdown files, images,
bibliographies, videos, audio files) is currently not licensed.
It is copyright Reuben Thomas 2016. All rights reserved.
This may change in the future once I've decided on a nice permissive license...
