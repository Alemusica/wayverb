% Frequency Dependent Locally Reacting Surfaces

Introduction
============

Modelling boundary surfaces in the digital waveguide mesh (DWM) is a problem
that is yet to be solved in a way that is flexible, accurate, and realistic.
Methods from the literature each have unique drawbacks, meaning none are
particularly satisfactory for applications where realism is required.
This essay will review some methods for boundary modelling, explain the
choice of method to implement, and present an analysis of the implementation.
