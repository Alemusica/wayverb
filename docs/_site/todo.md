## generic

scholdoc -> pandoc in vagrantfile

Theme for 'normal' pages so that I can write in markdown, not worry about
references etc.

Looks like the workflow will be
    write in scholarlymarkdown
    generate site locally
    push to github

    This is fine, it lets me stop worring about whether or not stuff is
    supported by github's jekyll verstion etc.
        BUT I should probably keep a site build environment somewhere
        or at least keep really detailed documentation about setting up a build
        env
